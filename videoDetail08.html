                    <li>
                        <p class="maR20">Up until the 14th century there was only one community in the Saas Valley: Saas. Four villages arose out of Saas - of those four Saas Fee, also known as "The Pearl of the Alps", is the most renowned; 13 four thousand meter peaks surround the glacier village, which is located at an altitude of 1800 meters above sea level.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">The car-free Saas-Fee (1800 m above sea level) lies at the foot of Switzerland's highest mountain, the Dom (4545 m above sea level), which can be admired particularly well from the highest revolving restaurant in the world. In summer, numerous excursion destinations, 350 km of hiking and theme trails and, last but not least, the cuddliest inhabitants of the village: the famous tame marmots, attract visitors. In the cold season, Saas-Fee with its excellent snow conditions and fantastically prepared pistes is THE mecca for winter (sports) fans and all those who want to become one.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Winter</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">Saas-Fee, with 150 kilometres of pistes, has blue, red, black and yellow runs. These promise unique skiing pleasure, always surrounded by 13 four-thousand-metre peaks! For non-alpine skiers, there are winter hiking trails and a long cross-country ski trail. Various toboggan runs offer a change from skiing.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Summer</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">In addition to around 350km of hiking trails and numerous theme trails, the tame marmots that you meet below the Spielboden mountain station are an exceptional experience. Adventure-seekers can cross the Gorge Alpin, the stream gorge between Saas-Fee and Saas-Grund, along steep rock faces in the company of a mountain guide. In the adventure forest in Saas-Fee, those with a head for heights can shimmy from tree to tree on various courses on lianas or suspension bridges, or speed through the forest landscape on the "Feeblitz" summer and winter toboggan run. The Saas Valley also has a 70 km long mountain bike network.</p>

                        <h3 class="unR30">Family</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">Saas-Fee/Saas Valley offers exciting family holidays. A varied children's programme in the midst of the highest Swiss mountains ensures adventure and action without end. Close to nature: in summer with the marmots or in winter on 145 km of pistes.</p>
