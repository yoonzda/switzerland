                        <p class="maR20">The vacation region around the Black Lake and in the Eastern Freiburg Pre-Alps (Voralpen) is well-known for its authenticity and its wild, romantic natural landscape, which includes the dark appearance of the Black Lake and the Brecca Abyss, an Alpine valley formed by glaciers.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">According to legend, the water of the Black Lake has been so dark since a giant washed his feet in the lake. Depending on the light conditions, the mountain lake shimmers in various hues, ranging up to turquoise-blue.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">Chair lifts, ski lifts, pistes, snow shoe routes and winter hiking trails satisfy the desires of winter sports enthusiasts. The summer offerings range from bathing in the up to 22 degrees Celsius, sulfur-rich water of the Black Lake, to extensive hikes, for instance to the Brecca Abyss, home to a myriad of Alpine flowers and Alpine fauna.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Winter</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">In the family-friendly skiing area of Schwarzsee/Kaiseregg, with a chair-lift, several T-bars and a Swiss ski school, there is fun to be had by skiers, carvers and snowboarders on 22 km of pistes. There are marked snow-shoe trails awaiting the friends of the “silent winter sport”. As soon as the ice is thick enough, the frozen Schwarzsee is open to skaters, walkers and cross-country skiers.</p>

                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Summer</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">A chair-lift gives access to the Riggisalp/Kaiseregg area (2185 m), starting point for lots of varied alpine tours. For hikers, there is a 200 km long network of paths. Round the lake is a popular 4 km long walk. You will have opportunities for bathing, rowing, fishing in the lake and the little Sense river and also mini-golf during your stay. For mountain bikers, there are 180 km of marked routes. Roar down from Riggisalp with a monster scooter - tremendous fun for the whole family!</p>
                        <p class="maR20">You will find old traditions kept alive in the typical mountain huts, serving local specialities. In the primeval karst landscape of the Brecca Gorge, walkers experience the full force of nature and may even spot marmots, chamois or a circling golden eagle. Since 1996, this natural paradise has been included in the Swiss Inventory of Landscape and Natural Monuments of national importance (BLN). The scenery can be experienced at close quarters on a two-day hiking tour, staying the night in mountain huts.</p>

                        <p class="maR20">Farms, residences and inns that are widely scattered around the lake make up the vacation resort of Schwarzsee, the gateway to the family-friendly Black Lake region. Chair lifts, ski lifts, pistes, snow shoe routes and winter hiking trails satisfy the desires of winter sports enthusiasts. The summer offerings range from bathing in the up to 22 degrees Celsius, sulfur-rich water of the Black Lake, to the new playground « Dragonland Kaiseregg » and extensive hikes, for instance to the Brecca Abyss, home to a myriad of Alpine flowers and Alpine fauna..</p>
