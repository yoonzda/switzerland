                    <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">The setting of Lausanne is extremely picturesque: it is hardly surprising that the International Olympic Committee has been based here since 1914. The town is built on three hills, surrounded by vineyard-covered slopes, with Lake Geneva at its feet. Rising impressively from the opposing French lakeshore are the Savoy Alps. The attractive old town is largely car-free. Small alleyways with cafes and boutiques shape the streetscape in the medieval city centre.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">The old town is dominated by the cathedral, which is regarded as Switzerland’s most impressive piece of early Gothic architecture. Lausanne was a diocesan town for over a thousand years.  can be found surrounding the cathedral as well as in the pretty waterfront area of Ouchy. Switzerland’s only «metro» connects the various parts of the town and eases travel in this incline-based town.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Also worthy of a visit are the parks, containing many Mediterranean plant species, and grand palace hotels like the Beau-Rivage Palace in Ouchy and the Hotel de l'Angleterre, were Lord Byron once stayed. Gourmets will be able to savour many regional specialities in Lausanne such as cabbage-filled sausage with leek gratin called "Papet Vaudois". Mind you, master chef Fredy Girardet who was voted «Cuisinier du siècle» or chef of the century by his colleagues has in the meantime retired and handed over his sceptre in the Hôtel de Ville to his successor.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Even lovers of culture won’t feel short changed in Lausanne: the collection of marginal art (“Art Brut”) in Beaulieu Castle, the Fondation de l'Hermitage, the «Musée de l'Elysée» photo museum, and many others merit a visit. Not forgetting Aquatis, the largest freshwater aquarium in Europe, a veritable living museum. The offering of theatre productions and musical performances too is above average. Finally, Lausanne is home to the world-famous Béjart Ballet.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">The «Olympic capital» is home to the Olympic Committee and also the Olympic Museum, the world’s largest information centre about the Olympic games. But sport in general is given a high profile here, examples of which are the «Lausanne Marathon» and «Athletissima», the international meeting for track and field athletics.</p>

                    <p class="maR20">Lausanne, the Olympic capital, is a centre renowned for its educational and research facilities, and is an unmissable destination for business tourism. The cradle of the Olympic movement teems with activities, creating a unique environment where the worlds of sport, culture, technology, medical research and innovation all come together. In terms of nature, the city opens out onto one of Switzerland’s most beautiful landscapes, with stunning panoramic views of Lake Geneva and the Alps. This makes it an ideal starting point for any excursion or incentive activity. A small city, and one of the greenest in Europe, Lausanne was named “best small city in the world” (fewer than 200,000 inhabitants) by the prestigious Monocle magazine.</p>
