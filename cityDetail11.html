            <p class="maR20">Delémont (German: Delsberg) is the capital of the canton of Jura and lies between the cities of Basel and Biel/Bienne in the north-west of Switzerland, close to the border with France. The small historic town lies within the densely forested and hilly Jurassic landscape. Medieval buildings, picturesque house facades, beautiful fountains and inviting terraces form the townscape of the old town.</p>

                    <p class="maR20">The youngest canton capital in Switzerland has a rich history as well as a charming old town. There are numerous historical buildings to discover, including the town hall, church of St. Marcel and the castle, the former summer residence of the Prince-Bishop of Basel. The two town gates to the medieval old town, the “Porte au Loup” and the “Porte de Porrentruy”, and parts of the former city wall are still in good condition. The squares in the old town are decorated with five monumental, Renaissance-style figure fountains dating back to the 16th century. The old town is also home to the Jurassic Museum of Art and History, which provides more information about the region with interactive exhibitions for all ages.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">On the “Circuit Secret Delémont”, there are six unusual places to get to know or rediscover in Delémont. Equipped with a digital key, visitors can visit the city’s sights, including the Porte au Loup, the bell tower of the church of St. Marcel and the castle’s guard house. All the sites are brought to life through animated projections created by Dexter Maurer, a talented artist from the Jura.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Delémont also has plenty to offer in terms of culture. The Chappuis-Fähndrich Museum is one of a kind. And perhaps especially worth a visit for that very reason. It boasts an impressive collection of everyday objects from times gone by in the Jura. Numerous objects have been saved from disposal or oblivion and can now be admired here. The “Delémont’BD” festival takes place each year in June and is dedicated to the world of comic books. The new Jura Theatre was also opened in October 2021.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Swiss Labyrinth: In summer, Delémont plays host to the Swiss Labyrinth, a unique experience for guests of all ages. Families and visitors alike try to find their way back out of this huge maize labyrinth. An illustrated guide helps them find their way. There are also bouncy castles, trampolines, swings, a restaurant and a relaxation area.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Jumping Jack - Jura trampoline park: In the Jumping Jack trampoline park, which stretches out over more than 750 square metres, six jumping zones invite visitors to bounce and jump to their heart’s content on various trampolines. Open all year round, the trampoline park offers recreational fun for both the young and the young at heart, e.g. as part of birthday parties, family excursions or a happy day out with friends.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">The city is the perfect starting point for excursions into the surrounding countryside. You can explore the hilly surroundings by bike and are guaranteed a beautiful view of the city. A 13-km circular path, the “Sentier Auguste Quiquerez” leads from Delémont to Soyhières and then back again to Delémont. The archaeology, flora and fauna, geology as well as ecology of the surrounding region are explained on 30 information panels. Several historic buildings are encountered en route, such as the Chapelle du Vorbourg (Vorbourg Chapel), which is located above the town. This place of refuge enthroned upon a cliff offers a magnificent view of the Birs valley.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">A sculpture trail, the “Balade de Séprais”, west of Delémont attracts visitors with its monumental, modern sculptures. It is a living exhibition, which means that it changes over time. New works join the collection of sculptures every year. On the other hand, some of the works designed by their creators to be short-lived - and made of straw, hay, leaves, paper or flowers - disappear to be replaced by new works.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">The Delémont valley can be explored on foot or by bicycle: Delémont is the ideal starting point for sporting activities in the great outdoors. The Delémont region offers numerous hiking and cycling trails that lead visitors through the beautiful Jura landscape.</p>
