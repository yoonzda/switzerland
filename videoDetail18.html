                        <p class="maR20">Nestled between the mighty Säntis massif and the seven Churfirsten peaks, the resorts of Alt St. Johann, Unterwasser and Wildhaus are among the highest-lying municipalities in Toggenburg. Eastern Switzerland's largest winter sports area is just one hour from the airport and Zurich.</p>

                        <p class="maR20">Children's hearts start beating faster at the Toggenburg holiday paradise, located in the eastern part of Switzerland. The resorts Wildhaus, Unterwasser and Alt St. Johann go to great lengths to ensure their guests - youngsters and adults alike - feel comfortable and happy.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Winter</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">You will find the largest winter sports resort in eastern Switzerland only one hour away from the airport and Zurich. 17 ski lift systems and cable railways will ease your ascent into the widely varied skiing and snowboarding area up to a height of 2262 metres above sea level. There you will find over 60 km of pistes waiting to be explored. One particularly memorable experience is skiing on the Sellamatt under the full moon.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">And anyone looking for relaxation away from the slopes can enjoy 50 km of groomed and marked winter rambling paths as well as 42 km of wonderfully laid out cross-country ski trails. You can also savour the peace and wonders of nature on a snowshoe tour through the snow-covered winter landscape. And if you find even this too energetic, then you can sit back and have yourself spoiled in one of our welcoming restaurants.</p>

                        <p class="maR20">A dense network of hiking trails covers the region. Among the trails is the multiple-day Toggenburg Mountain Tour extending for 87 kilometers from Wildhaus to Wil. Shorter theme-trails such as the Sound Trail, the Thur Trail, the Chnobel Path, or the Saga Trail invite you to discover Toggenburg by foot. A barefoot walk on the educational moor trail around the high moor of Rietbach near Krummenau lets you discover rare plants and is balm for body and soul.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">The hilly topography attracts mountainbikers as well. For these, Toggenburg offers 20 sign-posted routes, between 13 and 44 kilometers long. Numerous mountain lakes (Gräppelensee, Schönenbodensee and the Schwendi Lakes) attract swimmers.</p>

Practical offers such as kid’s material for rent, babysitting service and toy library. Creative kid’s program with animation and Snowland for young skiers and snowboarders in winter.</p>
