                        <p class="maR20">The world’s oldest rack-and-pinion railcar takes you high into the sky, while the state-of-the-art articulated railcar brings you down into the valley: Old and new technology work together in perfect harmony in this Rigi railroad experience, with the 150-year history of Europe’s first mountain railroad taking centre stage. An adventure full of contrasts for railroad enthusiasts, nostalgia fans and connoisseurs.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">Waiting patiently for its passengers at the elevated platform: Car no. 6. The railcar, steeped in history, is a treasure of times past. In its 110 years of service, it has travelled the equivalent of no less than nine circumnavigations of the globe and is believed to be the oldest electric rack-and-pinion railcar in operation in the world.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">Climb aboard, settle in to the cushioned benches and enjoy the ride! The stylish railcar carries passengers through the pre-Alpine landscapes of central Switzerland just as it did in the days of the Belle Epoque. Its destination? Rigi Kulm: Passengers can enjoy panoramic mountain views on the way to the summit. The Mythen twin peaks, Lake Zug and Rigi’s own waterfalls are the scenic highlights of this mountain trip. Note: The uphill journey is made with historic compositions, such as car no. 6, or a historic show car.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">As soon as they step from the train, passengers realise why the Rigi is considered one of the mountains with the most beautiful panoramic alpine views. Countless mountains line up, their peaks stretching into the sky as if vying for the sunniest spots. The view stretches from the Schwyz and Uri elevations over the Titlis glacier to the deep Bernese Oberland. Once guests have taken their fill of the spectacular panorama, they are quickly catapulted back to the modern world.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">This is because the descent to Vitznau is completed with the new, high-tech articulated railcar. This railcar captivates guests, not just with its elegant compartments, but also with important features such as low-floor wagons and recuperation. The train generates energy during the descent and feeds it back into the power grid. The energy demand from renewable hydropower is thus minimised and environmentally friendly travel is ensured! Passengers can enjoy the breathtaking view of the deep blue Lake Lucerne and the alpine mountains on exclusive wooden loungers and modern drop windows. A railroad experience with scenic highlights in the heart of Switzerland.</p>
