            <p class="maR20">Even the residents of Zug never tire of looking at it: when the sun sets over the lake, the horizon lights up ruby-red and all eyes are drawn to the romantic kaleidoscope of colours on the water. But even this is rivalled by the historic old town, where you can stroll through the labyrinthine narrow streets, saunter along the lakeside, or watch the colourful comings and goings from one of the many pavement cafés.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Zug is self-confident and knows what it has to offer: a high quality of life, a view of the Rigi and Pilatus, and a jewel of a historic centre. It’s a stylish town that values public art. This goes together with the town’s business world, which lends the pretty town a certain international flavour: well over 100 nations in Zug greet each other with a friendly “Grüezi”.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">History tells us that the town was founded in the early 13th century by the counts of Kyburg. The 52-metre-high Zytturm also dates back to this period. Initially built as a simple gateway in the old town wall, over the centuries it was expanded and its height increased until it attained the form we see today, with its oriel windows and steep hipped roof. In 1574 the great clock was built into it, giving the tower its present name. Under this main clock there is an astronomical timepiece with four hands indicating the week, the phase of the moon, the month, as well as whether it is currently a leap year.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">In Zug’s old town itself there are fine sights in the form of the late gothic town hall built in 1505 and St. Oswald’s church, from the same period. You can certainly lose yourself in the picturesque narrow streets of the old town, without actually getting lost: saunter past brightly coloured rows of houses, pretty boutiques and tempting restaurants - and you’ll end up in Landsgemeindeplatz, the main square on the lake.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">This is where Zug lives, celebrates and simply takes it easy on fine summer evenings. Children love the aviaries, fans of the water can hire boats, and romantics simply appreciate the world’s most beautiful sunset.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Winter</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Zug is certainly not just somewhere to visit in summer. It has plenty to offer during the coldest part of the year too. For example, there’s the Zugerberg, Zug’s local mountain. Eight minutes is all it takes to get out of the town and into the country. A short hike over the snow-covered winter landscape of the Zugerberg is particularly atmospheric. The Zugerberg provides a contrast to the town’s hustle and bustle with stillness, the beauty of nature and an impressive panorama.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">For the more energetic, the Zugerberg is a place where you can put on your cross-country skis and get going. At 925 metres above sea level and looking over the valley mist: the snowy upland landscape is the ideal terrain for it. You’re rewarded with a view of the Rigi and the Pre-Alps. Zug’s winter wonderland is a world of its own, and an inviting place to go sledging and snowshoeing as well.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">In Zug itself, winter is also a time for celebration. Old-time customs and traditions live on, such as Bäckermöhli, Zuger Fasnacht, Greth Schell, Chrööpfelimee and Märlisunntig. To find out what lies behind these quirky names, you’ll have to visit the charming town of Zug!</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Summer</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">In summer the whole town enjoys “la dolce vita” of Lake Zug - by, on, or in the water. A special surprise: all of Zug’s swimming spots are free to use, whether by the casino in the town centre, at the carefully maintained beach, or in the natural surroundings of “Brüggli”. It’s said that nowhere else in Switzerland is the sunset more impressive than at Lake Zug. You’ll have your own private box from which to take in the show if you go to one of the many lakeside restaurants on Lake Zug to enjoy an evening cocktail.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">If you feel like spending an idyllic summer’s day on the lake, go to one of the town’s three jetties, step onto one of the Lake Zug Navigation Company steamers and let it ferry you through the fairytale scenery. The fresh breeze, the feeling of leaving your everyday life behind and the view of the surrounding shores are as reviving as a day in a spa. But then again, there’s a whole host of sporting activities on offer, by, on and in the water: stand-up paddle boarding, wakeboarding or pedalos - to name but a few.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">But you shouldn’t miss a stroll through the old town either, which is situated right by the lake. 140 shops and restaurants nestle amid the historic houses of Zug’s old town. Traditional handicrafts meet timeless cultural goods; centuries-old traditions sit side-by-side with modern lifestyles.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Finally, a visit to the town of Zug should never be without a delightful taste of Kirschtorte, its famous cherry torte. Lovers of the Zuger Kirschtorte have included such Hollywood greats as Audrey Hepburn and Charlie Chaplin. Zug is proud to be known as the “Cherry Canton”. Numerous cherry-related customs and traditions are celebrated in the town and indeed in the whole region. Cherry walks are particularly popular, for example.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">And then there are social festivals and sumptuous events that are held from spring until late summer. Starting with the cherry blossom, moving on to the Zug Lake Festival and right through to Jazz Night.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Conferences and congresses</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Zug is seductive and particularly attractive for business events and incentives: in the heart of Switzerland, connected directly to the airport with first-class transport, and boasting a unique blend of urban lifestyle and proximity to nature, Zug has rightly been the focus of the international business world for years. This charming place, known for its sunset, cherries and two beautiful lakes, also extends a warm welcome to its visitors. Small is beautiful – never before has this phrase been more apt than for Zug, where guests will find everything to make an event great in the smallest of spaces. </p>
