                    <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Roses decorate the coat of arms of the town of Rapperswil-Jona located on the upper end of Lake Zurich, and all types and colours of this gorgeous flower bloom in Rapperswil’s public areas and three rose gardens. Rapperswil-Jona has a well-developed tourist infrastructure and as the region's transport hub is easily accessible by public transport.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">The castle towers above the town and lake and is the landmark. The castle hill affords a panorama view from the Glarus Alps all the way to the Zurich Oberland. Several churches, chapels and monasteries bears testimony to the past. The medieval old town with very little traffic – a protected historic monument, the lake promenade and varied excursion possibilities make Rapperswil particularly suitable for families with children.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">In addition to the lake dam for road and rail, a wooden bridge for pedestrians - probably not unlike in the past – provides access to the other side of the lake. This wooden bridge also happens to be the longest wooden bridge in Switzerland. And Rapperswil is also an embarkation point for the regular ship services on Lake Zurich, including two authentic paddle steamers, to Zurich.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">The area around Lake Zurich in addition to a wealth of beautiful scenery offers a whole range of fun and experience opportunities. Knie's Children's Zoo is a particular attraction for children and circus fans. The animals at the children's zoo can be stroked and there are also elephant rides on offer.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">In summer a 700-metre-long summer toboggan run on the nearby Atzmännig is great for some family fun. In winter there is a ski region suitable for families with easy ski pistes. On the other side of the lake, Pfäffikon with the Alpamare fun and experience baths featuring a wide range of water slides and wellness treatments is well worth visiting. Einsiedeln, the most important place of pilgrimage in Switzerland with a famous monastery, is accessible in 30 minutes.</p>

                    <p class="maR20">Welcome to Lake Zurich - one of the most attractive regions for meeting in Switzerland: The clear lake waters, its situation between the city of Zurich and the various mountains for excursions and the high-quality hotel and event locations are sure to please. Whether you wish to hold a meeting on or by the lake, an event on Switzerland's largest island, Ufenau, or a seminar in Rapperswil, the City of Roses - this multifaceted region is full of surprises with a wide variety of unique offerings.</p>
