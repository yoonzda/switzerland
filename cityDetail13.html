                    <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Zurich is a city that offers variety. A city where urban life is never far from nature. The old town can be found alongside the hip district, and luxurious brands alongside trendy labels. Opportunities for sightseeing and enjoyment of art are guaranteed. Parks and laid-back bars can be found by the lake or river. And you can get from A to B in no time at all by tram or by bus.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">The city is situated at the northern tip of Lake Zurich and on the Limmat river. Whether for a coffee or beer at a waterfront restaurant or a cruise on Lake Zurich with views of the Alps: the city is virtually unrivalled when it comes to combining cosmopolitan flair, nature and indulgence.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Zurich’s old town impresses with its historic buildings, picturesque alleyways and, of course, Zurich’s landmark, the Grossmünster church. The view from the Karlsturm tower is simply breathtaking! The Grossmünster is just a stone’s throw from the Fraumünster church with its world-famous Chagall windows.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">No sightseeing tour of Zurich would be complete without a visit to Bahnhofstrasse. This is one of the most famous shopping streets in the world. On Bahnhofstrasse, you’ll find luxury labels, as well as young brands, traditional boutiques and the Swiss classic: the Luxemburgerli macaroons at Confiserie Sprüngli.</p>

                <li>
                    <h3 class="unR30">Art and culture</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Anyone wanting to enjoy a bit of art and culture will not be disappointed by what Zurich has to offer! The Kunsthaus is Switzerland’s largest art museum. It presents major exhibitions with works by internationally renowned artists and houses one of the largest art collections in Switzerland, featuring art from the 13th century to the present day. The new expansion designed by Chipperfield Architects Berlin brings fans of architecture from around the world to Zurich.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">There is also an abundance of museums and galleries, such as the Rietberg Museum, Museum Haus Konstruktiv and the Museum für Gestaltung. All this plus the Swiss National Museum, with its unique collection on the cultural history of Switzerland.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">The gourmet city</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Zurich has a large and diverse gastronomic scene. Whether classic Swiss, Italian, Asian, Moroccan or Lebanese: there’s something here for everyone. Zurich’s traditional dish of Züri Gschnätzlets is, of course, available in many restaurants. And there are also some great options available for those wanting something vegan or vegetarian. Street food festivals are a huge part of Zurich’s culinary variety.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="unR30">Winter</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">There’s a lot going on in and around Zurich in winter. Those keen to get moving can head to the nearby mountains for skiing, snowshoeing, sledging or cross-country skiing. Anyone looking for a spot of relaxation can enjoy a trip to a hammam or spa, while gourmets might indulge in a fondue or hot chocolate. Zurich has a truly magical atmosphere throughout Advent and at Christmas. Alongside fairytale Christmas markets, events and light installations, Christmas in Zurich is also urban, chic and modern: quirky pop-up bars, design markets and festive sounds filling the air make Zurich’s Advent season feel so unique.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Summer</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Zurich is abuzz in summer: a time to meet on the promenades of Lake Zurich, in local neighbourhoods, on pretty garden terraces or in one of more than 40 “Badis” – how the Zurich inhabitants affectionately refer to their lidos by the water. In Zurich, the nearest recreational area, barbecue spot or hiking trail is never far away. Lush forests in and around the city provide fresh air and the opportunity for relaxing walks or sporting activities.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3 class="unR30">Conferences and congresses</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Economic centre, university city and boutique metropolis by the water offering a high quality of life: Zurich combines the advantages of a green and modern city at the foot of the Alps with excellent infrastructure and a strong network of business, education and ambitious start-ups. The city is a centre of research, development, business formation and innovation, not to mention a great place to live.</p>
