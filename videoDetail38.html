                    <li>
                        <p class="maR20">At 800 hectares, the terraced vineyards of the UNESCO region Lavaux form Switzerland's largest contiguous vineyard area with terrace after terrace offering magnificent views.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">St-Saphorin, Dézaley, Epesses - names which roll easily off the tongue of fans of fine wine. And the views from the Lavaux vineyards, set high above Lake Geneva, provide the perfect backdrop for winelovers. The natural, cultural and culinary highlights of this area are definitely well worth a visit. The steep vineyards, arranged in terraces, benefit from the sun and its warming rays three times over: from the rays coming straight from the sun, the ones bouncing off Lake Geneva, and those from the stored-up heat in the many stone walls.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">The blue-yellow "Train des Vignes" is a very convenient way to travel. In just twelve minutes it winds its way from Vevey through the lush green vineyards up to Puidoux-Chexbres. Here you can sample the local produce, as tasting is available at almost every cellar.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">Narrow alleyways and characteristic winegrowers’ houses are landmarks of villages such as St-Saphorin, with its Auberge de l’Onde, which can look back on a century of hospitality and serves up local delicacies on three floors.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">Now, to really get a taste you need to visit one of the charming pintes. These mini-restaurants are as typical of the Lavaux as are the original winegrowers' villages and the picturesque shores of Lake Geneva at the foot of its vineyards. All in all, Unesco deserves an award - as a world heritage.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">Explore the 800 hectares of the terraced winegrowing slopes of Lavaux on foot or by bicycle. A 32km path leads from Lausanne-Ouchy to Chillon Castle. On this route, there are seven circuits with educational signs that tell walkers all about local wine cultivation. Take part in a wine tasting in a wine cellar and be whisked away into the world of Vaud wines.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">Cave de Moratel Cave de Moratel Patricia and Denis Longet run a family winery in Cully; idyllically located on the shores of Lake Geneva. These passionate winemakers take guests on a walk through the vineyard - followed by a visit to cellar to taste the precious drops. There the winegrowers also tell of regional wine culture, the works and its fruits.</p>
