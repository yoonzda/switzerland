                    <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">It’s no surprise that Charlie Chaplin chose to spend his last 25 years on the hills of Vevey, that Freddie Mercury immortalised Lake Geneva with the peaks of Le Grammont on the cover of the album “Made in Heaven”, that Igor Stravinski composed “The Rite of Spring” in Montreux, or that Prince declared his love for Lavaux in a song named after the famous terraced vineyard, which is also a UNESCO World Heritage site.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">From Villeneuve to Lutry, along the shores of Lake Geneva, Montreux Riviera enjoys a microclimate that gives it a Mediterranean flair. The atmosphere is perfect for relaxing, going on walks, discovering new areas, and the climate is ideal for a rich terroir, cultivated expertly by restaurateurs and winegrowers.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">A few minutes from the shore up on the hills, forests interspersed with meadows invite walkers to roam the hiking trails, observe blossoming wild narcissus - known locally as “the snow of May” - and admire a panorama that transforms with each season. The arrival of the first snowflakes signals the beginning of Alpine fun, on skis, snowshoes or simply on foot.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">For less sporty visitors, Chaplin’s World and Chillon Castle are the top museum choices. Why not let yourself be tempted by a ride aboard a historical CGN ship, or a Belle Epoque train on the GoldenPass line?</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Montreux Riviera is a land of contrasts. It’s a kind of miniature Switzerland where visitors and locals have been living together for three centuries. The region is especially rich in cultural events, including the unmissable Montreux Jazz Festival, and boasts some of the best hotel schools and private clinics in the world. It is also a business hub with infrastructure that is perfectly suited to organising international conferences.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Winter</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Up high on Rochers-de-Naye and Les Pléiades, on snowshoes, skis or on a sunny terrace, Montreux Riviera combines the joys of winter and a lake view with fantastic cosy restaurants serving traditional dishes. In the heart of the old town or on the shores of the lake, the Vevey Christmas market and the famous Montreux Noël invite you to share precious moments in a festive atmosphere.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Summer</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">When the sun shines, it’s the perfect time to discover the many sides of Montreux Riviera. From the terraced vineyards of Lavaux to the quays of Villeneuve, Montreux and Vevey, from hiking trails to the stages of the most popular festivals, there’s a hint of joie de vivre about the place. A wide range of experiences to enjoy as you wish.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Conferences and congresses</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Montreux Riviera is the ideal place for unforgettable events. Ideally nestled between the lake and the Alps, Montreux Riviera with its microclimate and its sun-filled Lavaux Vineyards (UNESCO World Heritage) is the absolute top destination for meetings and events. Centrally located and close to the international Airport of Geneva, the destination is an outstanding place to hold international congresses, conferences, or incentives. A unique region, attached to its roots but open to the world, Montreux Riviera, home of the world famous Montreux Jazz Festival has inspired many artists over the years.
