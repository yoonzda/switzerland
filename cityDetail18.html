                    <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">Complete with gable paintings, the covered, medieval Chapel Bridge forms the centrepiece of Lucerne’s townscape and is considered to be one of the oldest, covered wooden bridges in Europe. A further landmark of the town is the Museggmauer, a wall which, with the exception only of one of its towers, has been preserved in its original, well-fortified state.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Historic houses decorated with frescoes line the picturesque town squares as they do the ‘Weinmarkt’ square in the car-free old town. Lucerne is a city of town squares and churches. The Jesuit church dating from the 17th century is regarded as Switzerland’s first sacral Baroque building and the twin towers of the Hofkirche form an integral part of the townscape. The figure of a dying lion which was hewn from the face of rock in remembrance of the heroic death of Swiss guards killed during an attack on the Tuileries in 1792 is one of the best-known monuments in Switzerland. And with its 112-metre-long Bourbaki panorama, Lucerne possesses one of the world’s few maintained, mammoth circular paintings.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Tradition and modernity stand side-by-side with ease in Lucerne, as the town has also earned a reputation for itself with innovative design. The futuristic Culture and Convention Centre (KKL), designed by leading French architect Jean Nouvel, is one the architectural highlights of the town. The KKL is also a landmark of «Lucerne: Festival City» and venue for a wide variety of cultural events throughout the year.</p>
                    <p class="maR20">Lucerne is the ideal starting point for many excursions to the highlights of central Switzerland. A trip up one of Lucerne’s regional mountains, the Pilatus or the Rigi – the queen of mountains – is a must. But excursions up onto the Stanserhorn, the Bürgenstock or a steamship cruise on Lake Lucerne with its many bends and arms are certainly no less worthy. The Gotthard Panorama Express originates in Lucerne and ferries its passengers to the foot of the Gotthard pass via Lake Lucerne and then continues by rail into Ticino, south of the Alpine ridge. The «cherry road» leads from Lucerne through the landscape of cheery trees and kirsch.</p>

                    <h3 class="unR30">Conferences and congresses</h3>
                    <p class="maR20">With first-class infrastructure and a diverse range of hotels, Lucerne in the very heart of Switzerland leaves nothing to be desired. The city boasts multifunctional event centres such as the world-famous KKL Luzern (Lucerne Culture and Convention Center) designed by star architect Jean Nouvel and a large number of hotels with state-of-the-art infrastructure. Lucerne offers the ideal setting for your event. With its magnificent lakeside location and Alpine peaks almost close enough to touch, the city is the ideal starting point for supporting programmes and team events. It is beautifully laid out and offers a wide variety of sights, cultural attractions and unique shops.</p>
