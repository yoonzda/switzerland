                </div>
                <ul class="context">
                    <li>
                        <p class="maR20">Gstaad is popular with a charming mix of visitors: in addition to celebrity guests in the chalet village of Gstaad itself, the smaller, rustic neighbouring villages offer attractive options for families with children. The centre of Gstaad has developed into a popular shopping area in recent years, and is the shortest shopping street in Switzerland.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Description</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">With its top hotels, gourmet restaurants, luxury chalets and nearby Saanen airport, this traffic-free holiday village is popular with international celebrities.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">When you include the neighbouring towns of Saanen, Schönried, Saanenmöser, Zweisimmen, Gsteig, Lauenen, Feutersoey, Turbach and Abländschen, the Saanenland region has just so much to offer: The nature reserve by the idyllic waters of Lake Lauenensee with its waterfalls and raised bogs, the narrow streets and alleyways of the historic village centre of Saanen or the peace and quiet of the dreamy mountain village of Abländschen are just a few examples of what you can expect from this extremely diverse destination.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">A major centre of winter sports, Gstaad has over 47 chair lifts. These can be reached from several villages by link transport facilities. The Montreux-Oberland railway and/or buses connect Gstaad with the valley stations in Saanenmöser, Schönried, Zweisimmen, Gsteig, Reusch, Lauenen, Rougemont, Col-du-Pillon and Château-d’Oex in the French-speaking neighbouring region of Pays d’Enhaut.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Winter</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">200km of slopes situated between 1,000m and 3,000m above sea level await skiers and snowboarders in winter. Guests can choose from several snowparks, numerous tobogganing runs and 42 kilometres of perfectly groomed cross-country ski trails – half of which are classic trails and half of which are designed for skating. There are around 185 kilometres of winter hiking trails. The more unusual activities include Bavarian curling in the centre of Gstaad or glacier and helicopter skiing.</p>
                        <p class="maR20">Winter in the smaller towns in the region, such as Lauenen, means peace and quiet and enjoying long winter hikes, cross-country skiing or romantic horse-drawn sleigh rides.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h3 class="unR30">Summer</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">The wide, open landscape of the Saanenland region offers a wide range of sporting activities: Hiking (on a network of trails of more than 300km), mountain biking, paragliding or golf. Whitewater rafting and canoeing adventures await on the River Saane. Summer cross-country skiing is available in the “Glacier 3000” glacier ski area. The Schönried summer sled run, a via ferrata and the natural paradise of Lake Lauenensee are all ideal destinations for family excursions.</p>

                        <h3 class="unR30">Conferences and congresses</h3>
                        <p class="maR20">As a tourist destination Gstaad is hard to beat; it’s a place where guests and locals are in harmony with nature and can enjoy the charms of all four seasons. There’s something special to discover around every corner, whether that’s the excellent infrastructure or the countless opportunities for memorable activities. Ideas then seem to bubble up like a sparkling mountain stream.</p>
